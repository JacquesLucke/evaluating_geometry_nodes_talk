            * Both are problems.
            * Dependency cycles are always a problem though, and not specific to this evaluation approach.
              * Ideally, we could just enforce that the user has to fix the file in case of dependency cycles.
                In practice that does not really work unfortunately.
              * There are many production files that kind of work even though they have dependency cycles.
                We don't want to break them all.
              * Sometimes there are dependency cycles in the depsgraph, even when there technically shouldn't be.
                That can happen because the depsgraph is not fine-grained enough.
              * In node systems, cycles are much more obvious fortunately and it's ok that the user has to
                fix them to make things work again.
            * Animated visibility is a more complex problem though.

          <h2>Animated Visibility</h2>
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            * [ ] Add an example for animated/driven visibility.
            * The problem is that to determine whether an object is visible, part of the depsgraph has to be evaluated first.
            * However, the push based approach requires that we know what has to be evaluated before we start evaluating.
            * The solution for the depsgraph is currently to evaluate in passes.
              * First evaluate everything that is required to determine visibility of all the objects with animated/driven visibility.
              * Then check again which depsgraph nodes have to be evaluated and evaluate those.
              * (Technically, there are 4 passes, one more for `COPY_ON_EVAL` and one for single threaded operations.)
            * This approach does handle the most common cases but is not very generic and does not handle other situations:
              * Objects are conditionally used by other objects even if they are not visible directly.
            * We'll later see how this is solved more generically in geometry nodes.
              * Unfortunately, the requirements are a bit different there so that the solution can not be easily applied
                to the depsgraph.

            * That means instead starting evaluation at the input nodes, it starts at the output node.
              * Each node recursively schedules its dependencies.

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            * Duplicate evaluation is big problem here, but it's fortunately fairly straight forward to solve
              with a temporary cache for socket values.
              * Does introduce a new problem though because there is no mechanism to free parts of the cache
                when it's no longer needed yet. So a simple cache would quickly require huge mount of RAM.
              * This recursive algorithm with a slightly more complex solution to avoid duplicate evaluation
                was actually the initial evaluator that geometry nodes had when it was first released.
            * Chains of nodes are a real problem as well. Each node in a chain adds a nested function call.
              * This can quickly lead to a stack-overflow with just a few hundred nodes, which many people
                ran into back then.
              * Later versions of the evaluator don't use recursion for every node anymore. So that's not
                really a problem nowadays for geometry nodes.
            * Node groups work fine in this initial version, but only because there was some extra code that
              essentially inlines all node groups into a single tree. Let's talk about that more.

            * [ ] Add image for inlined node groups.
            * There are two main ways to deal with node groups.
              * Inline everything into a single tree for evaluation.
              * Keep groups separate and deal with them in the evaluator.
            * Inlining groups:
              * Generally nice because it keeps the evaluator simpler.
              * This approach is used by original geometry nodes, shader and compositor nodes.
              * It does come with significant limitations though.
            * Keep groups:
              * Much better suited once node groups become much larger and numerous.
                * Often node group assets contain lots of nodes that are only sometimes used.
                * Always inlining all of them is a lot of unnecessary work.
              * Can preprocess groups in parallel and changes in one does not require inlining
                everything again.
              * Repeat zone and other future zones do require nested evaluation anyway. They can't
                be implemented by just statically inlining everything into a single flat tree.

          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            * As we've seen already, lazy-functions are composed in a graph.
            * The nice thing is that if we give the graph some input and output sockets, we end up with a new
              lazy-function that can be embedded into other graphs.
            * This is how node groups are implemented.
              * Each group is turned into a lazy-function, that is then embedded into the groups that use it.
              * Thanks to the design of lazy-functions that just works and behaves pretty much exactly the same
                as if everything was inlined with respect to lazyness.
              * We could still optionally inline some node groups, but for now that hasn't really been worth it.
            * Repeat zones are also just a dynamically generated lazy-function graph. This also allows for parallelism
              across iterations.

              * Having to wait for shader compilation for e.g. EEVEE is already bad enough.
            * Much harder to debug.

            * There are of course many things one needs to keep in mind when building evaluation systems.
              * Caching, threading, vectorization, benchmarking, scheduling, ...
            * Here are some tips that I haven't heard as often yet:
              * Optimize for optimizeability:
                * You can't optimize everything from the beginning.
                * Also you don't know which parts are important to optimize yet.
                * Optimize for a smooth profile flame graph (todo: show example) with small functions at the top.
                * This makes it easy to find bottlenecks and also to address them.
              * Consider lazyness early on
                * Lazyness allows skipping unnecessary work.
                * Retrofitting it into an existing evaluation system is hard because it usually fundamentally changes
                  how it has to work.
                * Avoiding work will always be faster than doing it efficiently.
            * Compare performance not against others but against the best possible performance.

            * Refactor field evaluation to be less stupid. The code has barely changed from the initial implementation
              when we introduced fields. There are some obvious bottleneck with non-trivial fields.
            * Socket value cache across depsgraph evaluations. This is quite tricky because there is not much information
              about what changed exactly since the last time.
            * GPU acceleration. This is most tricky because we're not the "end of the pipeline" generally like a renderer
              or compositor is. The output of geometry nodes is often still needed on the CPU. Choosing which parts should
              be on the GPU and which not is hard. Furthermore, this also introduces new complexity with respect to
              scheduling because the GPU works asynchronously, but I'm fairly confident that the lazy-function system
              can be adapted to support this.
